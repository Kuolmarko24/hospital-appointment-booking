how to host a laravel project
-push your code to yur git repo
===git init
===git add .
===git commit "laravel project
== git add origin http...
== git push -u origin master

++create a a heroku account and login to it
==click on New at the top right corner and click on Create new app
==give the app name in lower case,
== leave the region as USA by default
==create new pipeline(same name as the app name)
==click on create app
==click on connect to github
==search for a repo to connect to 
==click on search
==the repo should be listed and click on 
==Connect
==click on deploy branch
==your app was successfully deployed message will appear at the bottom  and then click on 
==View
==Forbidden message appears
==create a procfile in your root folder of your project and type the following code in it
	web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/
==then add the changes to your git repo by 
	git add .
	git commit -m "procfile added"
	git push -u origin master
==click on "deploy branch" button again and then click on 
==View
	and this time there is another diff error which is 500 | server error
	NOTE: This error normally happens when laravel is looking for env variables and it cant find it 
	and that means you hav to add the .env file to your heroku dashboard and this is done by clicking on 
==Settings on the heroku dashboard and provide the following from the .env file
APP_NAME - hospital-appointment-booking
APP_ENV - local
APP_KEY - .....
APP_DEBUG true
APP_URL - https://hostingonheroku.herokuapp.com/

NOTE click on "Enable Automatic deploys" button such that whenever you make changes on your github repo then 
	they also be reflected into your herokuapp as well
